  { cat: "Numbers", tip: "Quantify everything. '12% churn reduction' beats 'reduced churn significantly' every time." },
  { cat: "Length", tip: "1 page is standard for <10 years experience in Canada. Recruiters spend 6-7 seconds on first scan." },
  { cat: "Summary", tip: "Your professional summary should mirror the job title. If they want a 'Data Scientist,' lead with 'Data Scientist with...'" },
  { cat: "Skills", tip: "Group skills by category and lead with the ones mentioned in the posting. Order matters \u2014 recruiters scan left to right." },
  { cat: "Projects", tip: "Academic projects count. Frame them with impact: what you built, what tools you used, and what the result was." },
  { cat: "Cover Letter", tip: "94% of hiring managers say cover letters influence interview decisions. The Problem-Solution format is the gold standard for 2026." },
  { cat: "Tailoring", tip: "80% of hiring managers view generic AI content negatively. Always personalize \u2014 swap at least 30% of the content per application." },
  { cat: "Action Verbs", tip: "Start bullets with strong verbs: Built, Designed, Optimized, Deployed, Reduced, Automated, Led, Delivered." },
  { cat: "Cover Letter Hook", tip: "Never start with 'I am writing to express my interest.' Open with a quantified achievement or company-specific insight." },
  { cat: "LinkedIn", tip: "Your LinkedIn should match your resume. Canadian recruiters will check \u2014 inconsistencies raise red flags." },
  { cat: "File Name", tip: "Name your file 'FirstName_LastName_Role_Company.pdf' \u2014 not 'resume_final_v3(2).docx'." },
  { cat: "PGWP", tip: "For Canadian roles, mentioning work authorization (PGWP eligible) can remove a major screening concern upfront." },
  { cat: "Cover Letter Length", tip: "70% of hiring managers prefer 250-400 words. 49% prefer half-page. Every sentence must answer 'Why hire me?'" },
  { cat: "Fonts", tip: "Stick to Calibri, Arial, or Garamond at 10-12pt. Creative fonts get mangled by ATS parsers." }

CANDIDATE DATA:
${JSON.stringify(MD)}

=== 2026 CANADIAN TECH RESUME RESEARCH (hard-coded rules) ===

ATS COMPLIANCE (90% of recruiters use ATS):
- Use standard section headings ONLY: "Professional Summary", "Technical Skills", "Education", "Professional Experience", "Projects"
- Mirror EXACT keywords from the job posting in skills and bullets (ATS matches literal strings)
- Distribute keywords across summary, skills, AND experience bullets (not just skills section)
- Never use icons, tables, columns, or non-standard formatting terms

BULLET POINT FORMULA (mandatory for ALL bullets):
[Strong Action Verb] + [What You Did] + [Tool/Method Used] + [Quantified Result/Business Impact]
- EVERY bullet MUST start with a different strong action verb: Developed, Engineered, Automated, Optimized, Deployed, Architected, Reduced, Accelerated, Designed, Implemented, Delivered, Built, Trained, Analyzed, Transformed, Extracted, Streamlined, Consolidated, Eliminated
- EVERY bullet MUST contain at least ONE metric: percentage, dollar amount, time saved, dataset size, accuracy score, number of users/records/models
- NEVER use weak verbs: Helped, Assisted, Worked on, Was responsible for, Participated in, Contributed to, Handled, Managed (without scope)
- NEVER write duty descriptions. Only achievements with quantified outcomes.
- Connect technical work to BUSINESS IMPACT: revenue, cost savings, efficiency gains, risk reduction, decision quality

PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY RULES:
- Start with the EXACT job title from the posting (e.g., "Data Analyst with..." or "Machine Learning Engineer with...")
- Include: years of experience, 3-5 top matching skills, strongest quantified achievement, and degree
- 2-3 sentences MAX. Every word must answer "Why should we interview this person?"
- Mirror 3-5 keywords from the posting naturally

SKILLS SECTION RULES:
- Group into exactly 4 lines with labels that match the posting's language
- Lead each line with the skills mentioned in the posting (order matters, recruiters scan left to right)
- Include the EXACT tool names (not generic categories): "Python" not "programming", "Tableau" not "visualization tools"
- Include specific libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, PyTorch (not just "Python libraries")

PROJECT RULES:
- Each project bullet must follow the same action verb + tool + metric formula
- Frame academic projects as professional deliverables with business impact language
- Include deployment/production indicators where relevant (Docker, Hugging Face, Streamlit Cloud, Netlify)

METRIC ACCURACY (CRITICAL — NEVER VIOLATE):
- NEVER invent, inflate, or exaggerate metrics. Only use numbers that appear in the candidate data.
- These are the ONLY accurate metrics you may use:
  * 12% risk reduction (churn models)
  * 8+ dashboards (Power BI/Tableau)
  * 10 hours/week saved (manual reporting)
  * 25% manual effort reduction (dashboards and VBA)
  * 500K+ records (SQL pipelines)
  * 40% faster reporting turnaround (ETL)
  * 18% forecasting accuracy improvement (time-series)
  * 50K+ transactions (JKL Python analysis)
  * $30K cost savings identified (JKL procurement)
  * 20% stockout reduction (JKL dashboards)
  * 15% customer retention increase (JKL CRM)
  * 18% delivery delay reduction (JKL supply chain)
  * 15% system failure reduction (Huawei diagnostics)
  * R2 > 0.91 (bike sharing), R2 = 0.9481 (Nashville housing)
  * macro F1 0.9353 (Intel CV), 96% MLP / 95.39% RF (MNIST)
  * 4,485 images, 11 classes (FruitNet)
  * 847K+ records (bicycle accidents)
  * 500K rows (Streamlit dashboard)
  * 30+ content pieces (writing)
  * 15+ presentations (stakeholder)
- If you need a number not in this list, use the closest accurate one or omit the metric.
- NEVER combine metrics to create larger fake numbers (e.g., don't add 8 dashboards + 10 JKL dashboards to claim 18+).

TOOL/SKILL ACCURACY (CRITICAL):
- ONLY include tools and technologies that appear in the candidate's skills data above.
- NEVER add tools the candidate hasn't listed: no MATLAB, no Databricks, no Spark (unless PySpark), no Kubernetes, no Airflow, no dbt, no Looker, no BigQuery.
- If the posting asks for a tool not in the candidate's skills, do NOT add it. Instead, emphasize the closest matching tool the candidate actually has.

KEYWORD MIRRORING (CRITICAL):
- Extract 5-10 exact phrases from the job posting and weave them verbatim into bullets and summary
- If the posting says "data quality and reliability," use those exact words — not "data accuracy"
- If the posting says "structured and unstructured data," use that exact phrase
- If the posting says "production deployments," use that exact phrase
- The goal is 80%+ keyword match with the posting's specific language

CANADIAN MARKET SPECIFICS:
- 1 page for <10 years experience (this candidate)
- No photos, age, marital status, or religion
- Include city only (Vancouver, BC), not full address
- LinkedIn URL is expected (92% of Canadian recruiters check)
- PGWP eligibility can be mentioned if posting asks about work authorization

${pr}

- include_airtel: true ONLY if posting values telecom, engineering, monitoring, KPIs, or emphasizes Canadian work experience
- include_writer: true ONLY if posting mentions technical writing, content creation, communication, documentation, or copywriting
- certifications: select 1-3 most relevant from: ai_practice (AI/ML/data science roles), fin_accounting (finance/banking/analyst roles), semrush_seo (marketing/SEO/digital roles), linkedin_writing (writing/content roles). Always include ai_practice for any tech/data role.
- ALWAYS include freelance and jkl (Jonathan Kings Limited) — they are core experience
- ALWAYS include huawei — it shows engineering background
- For jkl: select 3-4 best bullets matching the posting from: jkl_dashboards, jkl_reporting, jkl_python, jkl_crm, jkl_supply, jkl_stakeholder
- Rewrite bullet text to echo the posting's exact terminology and keywords while keeping metrics accurate
- Order projects by relevance to the posting, not by date

OVERVIEW RULES (mandatory — this is CRITICAL):
- The overview describes the CANDIDATE, not the job. NEVER describe what the role requires. NEVER start with "This role requires" or "The candidate needs."
- MUST be written in FIRST PERSON PERSPECTIVE about Joseph. It is HIS summary, selling HIM.
- MUST start with: "[Exact Job Title from posting] with 6+ years of experience in [2-3 matching skill areas]."
- SECOND sentence: strongest quantified achievement that matches the posting (e.g., "Built predictive models reducing client risk by 12% and automated dashboards eliminating 10+ hours/week of manual reporting.")
- THIRD sentence: education + what sets him apart (e.g., "Currently completing MS in Data Analytics (GPA 3.8) at Northeastern University with hands-on experience across [1-2 posting-relevant domains].")
- NEVER exceed 3 sentences. NEVER describe job requirements. ONLY describe the candidate.
- BAD example: "This role requires deep quantitative analysis and financial domain expertise." 
- GOOD example: "Data Analyst with 6+ years of experience in Python, SQL, and financial analytics. Engineered predictive models reducing client risk exposure by 12% and built 10+ automated Power BI dashboards for revenue forecasting. Currently completing MS in Data Analytics (GPA 3.8) at Northeastern University with expertise in machine learning and business intelligence."

COURSEWORK SELECTION:
- Select 6-8 most relevant courses from the candidate's coursework array that match the posting
- Return as coursework array in JSON

KEY HIGHLIGHTS:
- Generate exactly 3 bullet-point highlights — the candidate's top quantified wins most relevant to the posting
- Format: short, punchy, numbers-forward (e.g., "Reduced client risk 12% through ML prediction models")

SKILLS PROFICIENCY:
- For the top 3-5 most important skills, add proficiency level in parentheses: (Advanced), (Proficient), or (Intermediate)
- Python (Advanced), SQL (Advanced), R (Proficient), Tableau (Advanced), Power BI (Advanced) are the defaults — adjust if posting emphasizes different tools
- This helps ATS match keywords like "advanced SQL" or "proficient in Python"

MATCH SCORE:
- Count how many required skills/qualifications from the posting are matched by the candidate
- Return as match_score (0-100) and matched_keywords (array of matched terms)

YOUR ROLE:
- You CAN see the full resume above. Reference specific bullets, skills, and projects by name.
- Answer questions about resume-job fit, interview prep, skill gaps, application strategy
- Give specific, actionable advice — reference exact lines from the resume and exact requirements from the posting
- Be honest about gaps and misalignments — don't sugarcoat
- When suggesting improvements, give exact "refine instruction" text the user can paste into the Refine panel
- Keep responses focused: 3-8 sentences unless asked for detail
- If asked to evaluate, give a score out of 10 with specific reasons
- NEVER say "I can't see the resume" or "I can't see the job posting" — you have BOTH above
- NEVER ask the user to paste the job posting — you already have it
